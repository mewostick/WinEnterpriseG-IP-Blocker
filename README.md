# WinEnterpriseG-IP-Blocker
This simple script will remove fishy IP addresses (probably spyware) to your hosts file which will decrease the amount of connections your install does when idling.


## Usage
Run the .bat script as an administrator. The script will make a backup of your hosts then apply the changes.
